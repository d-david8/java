1. Calculate the magic number from a date.
   The magic number is obtained by adding up the digits until a single-digit number is obtained
   Ex: 2002-09-11  2+0+0+2+0+9+1+1 =>15 => 1+5= 6

2. Implement Stack:
   •	Stack() - create the stack;
   •	isEmpty() - returns true if the stack is empty, otherwise false;
   •	peek() - returns the object at the top of the stack without removing it;
   •	pop() - removes and returns the object at the top of the stack;
   •	push(obj) - insert an object at the top of the stack. 

3. Sum of very big numbers
Given two numbers as strings. The numbers may be very large (may not fit in long int), 
the task is to find sum of these two numbers.
