# Problem1: Find the Missing Number

Problem Description:
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one
missing number in the array.

Example:
Input: [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2

# Problem2: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

Problem Description:
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no
elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "ace" is a subsequence
of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example:
Input:
text1 = "abcde"
text2 = "ace"
Output: 3 (The longest common subsequence is "ace").

# Problem3: Longest Palindromic Substring

Problem Description:
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence
of characters that reads the same forward and backward. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"

# Problem4: Reverse Words in a String

Problem Description:
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Example:
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
