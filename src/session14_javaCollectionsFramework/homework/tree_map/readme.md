TreeMap

1. Write a Java program to associate the specified value with the specified key in a Tree Map.
2. Write a Java program to copy a Tree Map content to another Tree Map.
3. Write a Java program to search a key in a Tree Map.
4. Write a Java program to search a value in a Tree Map.
5. Write a Java program to get all keys from the given a Tree Map.
6. Write a Java program to delete all elements from a given Tree Map.
7. Write a Java program to sort keys in Tree Map by using comparator.
8. Write a Java program to get a key-value mapping associated with the greatest key and the least key in a map.
9. Write a Java program to get the first (lowest) key and the last (highest) key currently in a map.
10. Write a Java program to get a reverse order view of the keys contained in a given map.
11. Write a Java program to get a key-value mapping associated with the greatest key less than or equal to the given
    key.
12. Write a Java program to get the greatest key less than or equal to the given key.
13. Write a Java program to get the portion of a map whose keys are strictly less than a given key.
14. Write a Java program to get the portion of this map whose keys are less than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) a
    given key.
15. Write a Java program to get the least key strictly greater than the given key. Return null if there is no such key.
16. Write a Java program to get a key-value mapping associated with the greatest key strictly less than the given key.
    Return null if there is no such key.
17. Write a Java program to get the greatest key strictly less than the given key. Return null if there is no such key.
