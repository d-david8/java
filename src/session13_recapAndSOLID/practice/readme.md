1. Char to Int Conversion:
   Write a program that prompts the user to enter a single character. Convert the character to
   its corresponding int value using the Character.getNumericValue() method. What happens if the character is not a
   numeric digit? How can you handle this scenario?

2. Floating Point Precision:
   Write a program that calculates the average of three floating-point numbers. What happens if the sum of the three
   numbers exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a float? How can you handle this scenario?

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a day of the week and prints out a message indicating whether it is a
   weekday or a weekend day, using a switch statement.

4. Create a list of 7 random integers. Develop a program that identifies and prints the smallest and the largest numbers
   from the list.

5. Write a program that performs basic string compression by using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the
   string "aaabbbcccaaa" would become "a3b3c3a3".

6. Ask the user to enter a string. Then, create a program that reverses the string without using any built-in functions
   for reversing strings.

7. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string containing brackets "({[]})" and verifies whether the
   brackets are balanced and properly nested.

8. Ask the user to input a number n followed by n strings. Your program should find and print the longest common prefix
   of the n strings.
