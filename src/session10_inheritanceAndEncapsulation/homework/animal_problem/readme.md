Animal problem

1. Create an Animal class with sound() method that prints to console "animal makes sounds"
2. Create a Dog class that extends Animal and overrides sound() method; dogs make a particular
   sound, so we want to print "bark", in this case
3. Create a Cat class that extends Animal and overrides sound() method, and in this case, we want
   to print in our method "meow"
4. Create a Wolf class that extends Animal, and overrides sound() method, and print "how"
5. Create a TestAnimal Class with a main method, create objects with each animal class created (dog, cat, wolf)
   and call sound()
