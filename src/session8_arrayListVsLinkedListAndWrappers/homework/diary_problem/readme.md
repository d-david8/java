Write a program that manages a personal diary using an ArrayList. 
Each entry in the diary is a string that contains a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" followed 
by a colon and the diary entry for that day. Your program should allow the user to:
    Add a new entry (but ensure there's no duplicate date).
    Edit an existing entry based on the date.
    Delete an entry by date.
    Display all entries in reverse chronological order (latest first).

Ensure that all these operations are efficient, especially the addition of new entries, 
which should keep the list sorted without resorting it every time.
