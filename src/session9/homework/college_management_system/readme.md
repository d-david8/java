College Management System

Design a system for a college to efficiently manage information
about students, professors, and courses:

- Store comprehensive profiles for every student, capturing their first name, last name,
  sex, age, date of birth, CNP, and address.
- Similarly, maintain detailed profiles for every professor, including their first name,
  last name, sex, age, date of birth, CNP, and address.
- The college offers eight distinct courses: Math, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry,
  Biology, Geography, English, and History. For each course, track details like its schedule,
  duration, description, and the assigned professor.
- Allow for the assignment of a professor to a specific course and ensure the ability to retrieve
  and view course details, including its assigned professor.

Note: Think about the needed classes, attributes and methods. We should master OOP principles and
always find a way to transpose the objects from real life (or the business domain) to our application,
with Java code.

We should also know to explain the technical decisions we made.
