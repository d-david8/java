Fitness Tracking System

Design a system for individuals who want to track their fitness activities:

- Users can log different types of workouts, such as running, weightlifting, or yoga.
- Each workout type has specific attributes like duration, distance, or weight lifted.
- Users can set weekly fitness goals, like running a certain number of kilometers or lifting a specific total weight.
- Generate a summary at the end of the week, showing all logged workouts and indicating if the user met their goals.
- Allow users to search and view their past workouts based on the type of activity or date.
