Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'. $100, $150 and $200 are deposited in banks A, B
and C respectively. 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' are subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method named '
getBalance'. Call this method by creating an object of each of the three classes.
