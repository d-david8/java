Online Store Checkout System

Design a system for an online store that allows users to:

Add items to their shopping cart. Each item has a name, price, and a unique identifier.
View the contents of their cart, displaying the name and price of each item.
Calculate the total cost of the items in their cart.
Each item added should automatically be assigned a unique identifier.
