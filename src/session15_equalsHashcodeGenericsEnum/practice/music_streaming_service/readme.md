Music Streaming Service

Goal:
Imagine a world where people have quick and easy access to their favorite tunes from anywhere and at any time. You are
tasked with designing a simplified version of a music streaming service, similar to Spotify or Apple Music. Users should
be able to interact with a vast library of songs, create their personalized playlists with their favorite tracks, and
enjoy listening to individual songs or full playlists. Consider functionalities such as shuffling the songs in the
playlist and repeating a particular song. The goal is to offer a user-friendly experience where music lovers can easily
navigate through a collection of songs and enjoy their personalized music experience.
